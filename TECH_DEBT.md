# Plan

1. needs to install `create-elm-app` and run `elm-app build` to run locally (on production, I run this build inside circle ci pipeline)
2. Probably I need to wrap landing page as docker image, and pull that docker image from production machine.

3. Write scripts to automate reproduce production db to local
